<a>I am presenting a very simplified version of a program to determine the space velocity a ship must have to reach a certain place in space in a certain time. The program has bugs (I will be slowly removing them). The first error is the assumption that each month consists of 4 equal weeks or 28 days, which is obviously not true. This is the first iteration of a program based on a basic velocity formula, which of course is not that trivial and I will improve it over time, e.g. using quaternion calculus. I'll provide improved versions as I progress, but I'm publishing this now because maybe someone will find it useful.

Since I also plan to deal with space navigation, the programme includes a module for speeds greater than the speed of light according to Alcubierre's propulsion theory. This part of the code is not currently available.</a>
