    A programme that calculates the speed of a spacecraft in space. 

    The constant DISTANCE here is the distance to any object in [km].

    The flight time is given in years, e.g. Ã¾ half a year 0.6, two years and three months 2.3, etc.

    The result is the speed in [km/s]. The programme for the special part of the Alcubierre drive also 
    calculates a speed greater than the speed of light. 
    
    The programme is an introduction to a doctoral thesis. 
    
    Example:
    distance = 500,000,000 km
    time = approx. 7.1 months = 218.67 days = 5248 hours = 314 885 minutes = 18 893 088 seconds

    speed = distance / time

    speed = 500 000 000 km / 18 893 088 seconds = 26.5 km/second
